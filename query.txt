 That he was going to leave the village of Srirampur on the following morning was because his duty now called him away from that place. He had now to roam from one village to another in order to contact people in their homes and carry the message of love and friendship to them. On other occasions, such as that of Dandi march, he had been followed by lakhs of people, but this time he would be going alone. It was his hearts prayer that when he left any place, people should be able to say of him that now one had left them who was their friend and not an enemy.

 We have much pleasure in announcing that the plague restrictions on the movements of the British Indians within the Transvaal itself, imposed by the Rand Plague Committee, have been withdrawn, and now Indians wishing to travel from one place to another in the Colony would no longer be required to submit to a medical examination and carry travelling permits. We wish to congra tulate our countrymen in the Transvaal on their deliverance, and more so on the exemplary patience shown by them. We have always held that the restrictions were totally unnecessary, though we have, at the same time, also advised that submission was the very best thing that could be done by them. The plague officially broke out in the middle of March last and, beyond the first virulent outbreak, it has never raged in a dangerous form. For the last three months, there have been only isolated cases, and these confined mostly to the Natives. And yet for four months and a half, the Indians have laboured under grievous disadvantages as to their movements. The statistics shew conclusively that, outside the Indian Location, the plague has been no respecter of persons,and outside Johannesburg hardly an Indian case had hap pened. Some of the districts have been absolutely free from any Indian cases. Moreover, the authorities have not been able to bring a single complaint against them. They have shown themselves willing and eager to fall in with the wishes of the authorities, and even when their houses and effects were burned down, and when they were asked to go to a camp thirteen miles from the town, they did so without grumbling. Dr. Turner, the Medical Officer for the Colony, has deli berately given it as his opinion that, for the outbreak in the location in Johannesburg, the Indians were in no way to blame, and that the authorities, having neglected their first duty as to keeping the place in a sanitary condition, were responsible for the state of affairs. Hun dreds of Indians, who have been rendered homeless and whose goods have been destroyed, are yet without payment of any compensation whatsoever or without a fixed abode. We take leave to say that very few communities are to be found in the world behaving in the manner in which the Indians have during the trying ordeal, and under most vexatious difficulties. Will the Government take note of this? Will the Rand Plague Committee, which has come in close contact with the people, have the courage to give the Indian his due? Will Mr. Lyttel ton take into consideration these facts in approving of any restrictive
