 DEAR SIR, Your brother and my friend, Mr. H. Kitchin, has written to me sending your address. He is anxious, and so am I, that I should make your acquaintance during my brief stay in London, and I shall thank you if you will kindly make an appointment. I shall be exceedingly busy this week with reference to the Deputation that is to wait upon Lord Elgin. Will you therefore kindly make an appointment for some time next week?
